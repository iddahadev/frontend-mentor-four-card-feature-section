## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the CUBE CSS methodology and tried to implement some blocks and utilities.

**Some utility examples**
```css
.shadow {
  box-shadow: 0px 15px 30px -11px rgba(131, 166, 210, 0.50);
}

.radius {
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

This introduction to CUBE CSS was interesting! I would like to practice more on that subject alongside BEM.
